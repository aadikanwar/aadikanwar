# Hi, I'm Aadi! 👋🏽
I am a first year student at the University of British Columbia, hoping to bridge the gap between the fields of Mathematics and Computer Science. 

## My Current Interests 
- I am currently interested in concepts of Machine Learning and Statistics, namely implementing classifiers in R and Python
- I am interested in learning about more mathematical concepts in Number Theory
    - Currently reading Tao's Analysis I, shoot me a message with more book recommendations!
- I am currently working on building a series of mathematical modelling in Python using the Manim library (credit to 3Blue1Brown)
    - I have currently explored The Gaussian Integral, check out the .mp4 file in the repo titled "A Brief Introduction"!
